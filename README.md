# Cactus Text Game Engine 

---

[Cactus](http://shearofdoom.github.io/Cactus/) is a simple engine used to build Zork-style adventure games. Cactus is still in it's early stages of development, but will be updated as regularily as possible, and with as many new features as possible. I hope you enjoy Cactus!
