It's super easy to install Cactus:

1. Download the latest stable version of Cactus (links on **[the homepage]({{ site.base_url }}/)**). Make sure to download from the links on the homepage, as GitHub gives you the in-development version, which might have some issues.
2. Add `Cactus/CactusSource` folder to your `PYTHONPATH`. This won't be covered, but there are plenty of tutorials online on how to add items to your `PYTHONPATH`.
