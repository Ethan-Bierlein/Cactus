Do you love Cactus and want to help out with development? We'd love to have you!

Even if you'd rather not program the engine itself, we'd love to have you help! We need people for these things:

- Graphic design
- QA/Testing
- Documentation writing/editing
- Adding new ideas to **[our GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ShearOfDoom/Cactus/issues)**

If you want to help in any of those areas, please contact any member of the **[team]({{ site.base_url }}/About/Team/)** or go to our subreddit (link in the header).

A much easier way to support us would be to give a shoutout on Twitter and tell your friends about Cactus.
