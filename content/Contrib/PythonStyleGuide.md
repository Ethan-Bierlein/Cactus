We more or less follow the **[PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).** We do have the following changes to it:

- For classes, we use the argument `self` instead of `cls`, as PEP 8 requires
- We allow extra spaces around assignment
- Always use double quotes
- Always use docstrings for every method except `__init__()`
